In this Project we will work on the subset of the the synthetic IBM HR Employees Attrition dataset.

The dataset gives information about the employees in the organization and the target variable (Y) is Attrition, which tells whether an employee was replaced or not. We will look at the variables and different factors that affect employee performance, including factors like the work from home sitation, their job role, their monthly income, and other similar factors.
